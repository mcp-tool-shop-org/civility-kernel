## Scope

Civility Kernel is a **policy layer library** for preference-governed agent behavior.
- **Data accessed:** Reads JSON policy files from local filesystem. Validates, canonicalizes, and diffs policy documents in-process. All operations are deterministic and side-effect free.
- **Data NOT accessed:** No network requests. No telemetry. No cloud services. No credential storage. No runtime data collection. The kernel evaluates policy constraints — it does not observe or log agent actions.
- **Permissions required:** File system read access for policy JSON files. No write access required for the library itself (policy-check CLI writes only when explicitly requested via `--apply`).
